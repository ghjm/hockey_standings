### How this works

The green bars show the point standings that a team could possibly end the regular season with.

The left end of the bar is the points already earned: these cannot be taken away, so the team will definitely end the
season with at least this many points.  The left end moves to the right whenever the team wins a game.

The right end of the bar is the points the team could possibly earn if they won every remaining game.  The right end
moves to the left whenever the team loses a game (because those points are lost and no longer achievable).

The vertical blue lines show the playoff bubble - the earned or possible points of the 4th place team in the division.
The blue line on the left is the elimination threshold, and the one on the right is the clinching threshold.  If a
team's green bar is fully to the left of the leftmost blue line, then they are eliminated.  If the green bar is fully
to the right of the rightmost blue line, then they have clinched a playoff spot.  A team "controls their own destiny" if their green bar extends to the right of the rightmost blue line.

When the bar exactly touches the line, tiebreaker rules might matter.  (This graph does not show any tiebreaker 
information.)

The "Pace" dots show where the team would end the season if their points percentage for their remaining games was the
same as it has been for the season so far ("Season Pace"), or if they maintain the points percentage from their last 10
games ("Last 10 Pace").
